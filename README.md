## 理论价格计算
Okay, calculating the "理论价格" (Theoretical Price) of an option typically involves using an established option pricing model. Given the presence of the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho), the most probable model used here is the Black-Scholes-Merton model (often shortened to Black-Scholes), especially for these European-style options (assuming they are European, which is standard for index/stock options unless specified otherwise).

Here's how it works conceptually and the inputs needed:

1. The Model:
The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical formula that gives the theoretical price of European calls and puts.

2. Inputs Required (These are mostly provided in Image 1):

S₀ (Current Underlying Price - 股票价格): The current market price of the stock (99.50).

K (Strike Price - 行权价格): The price at which the option holder can buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying asset (e.g., 90, 95, 100, 105, 110).

T (Time to Expiration - 距离到期日的天数): The remaining time until the option expires, expressed in years. (91 days ≈ 91/365 years).

r (Risk-Free Interest Rate - 利率): The annualized risk-free interest rate for the duration T (6% or 0.06).

σ (Volatility - 波动率): The expected standard deviation of the underlying asset's returns, expressed annually (25% or 0.25). This is often implied volatility, derived from market prices, rather than historical volatility.

q (Dividend Yield - 预期股利): The expected continuous dividend yield of the underlying stock over the life of the option. In this case, it's given as 0.

3. The Calculation (Conceptual):
The Black-Scholes formulas for call (C) and put (P) prices are:

Call Price (C): C = S₀ * e^(-qT) * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)

Put Price (P): P = K * e^(-rT) * N(-d2) - S₀ * e^(-qT) * N(-d1)

Where:

e is the base of the natural logarithm (approx. 2.71828).

N(x) is the cumulative standard normal distribution function. It represents the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than x. This essentially acts as a probability weighting.

d1 and d2 are intermediate values calculated using the inputs (S₀, K, T, r, q, σ):

d1 = [ln(S₀/K) + (r - q + σ²/2)T] / (σ√T)

d2 = d1 - σ√T

ln is the natural logarithm.

4. How it's Done in Practice:
You wouldn't typically calculate this by hand. Instead, you would use:

Financial calculators.

Spreadsheet software (like Excel, Google Sheets) which have functions or allow you to build the formula.

Programming languages (like Python with libraries like py_vollib_vectorized or QuantLib)

Online Black-Scholes calculators.

Example (Conceptual for the 100 Strike Call):
The calculator would take S₀=99.50, K=100, T=91/365, r=0.06, σ=0.25, q=0, plug them into the formulas for d1 and d2, find the N(d1) and N(d2) values (using standard normal distribution tables or functions), and then plug everything into the Call Price formula. The result should be close to the 5.44 listed as the "理论价值" in Image 1.

In essence, the "理论价格" is the model-derived fair value of the option based on current market conditions and assumptions about how the underlying asset price might evolve.
